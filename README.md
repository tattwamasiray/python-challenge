# python-challenge
Background
It's time to put away the Excel sheet and enter the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where your newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.
Before You Begin
Before starting the assignment, be sure to complete the following steps:

Create a new repository for this project called python-challenge. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.

In each folder that you just created, add the following content:

A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

A Resources folder that contains the CSV files you used. Make sure that your script has the correct path to the CSV file.

An analysis folder that contains your text file that has the results from your analysis.

PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyse the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Your analysis should align with the following results:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your analysis should align with the following results:

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
Hints and Considerations
Consider what we've learned so far. To date, we've learned how to import modules like csv; to read and write files in various formats; to store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries; to iterate through basic data structures; and to debug along the way. Using what we've learned, try to break down you tasks into discrete mini-objectives. This will be a much better course of action than attempting to Google Search for a miracle.

As you will discover, for some of these challenges, the datasets are quite large. This was done purposefully, as it showcases one of the limits of Excel-based analysis. While our first instinct, as data analysts, is often to head straight into Excel, creating scripts in Python can provide us with more robust options for handling "big data".

Your scripts should work for each dataset provided. Run your script for each dataset separately to make sure that the code works for different data.

Feel encouraged to work in groups, but don't shortchange yourself by copying someone else's work. You get what you put in, and the art of programming is extremely unforgiving to moochers. Dig your heels in, burn the night oil, and learn this while you can! These are skills that will pay dividends in your future career.

Start early, and reach out for help often! Challenge yourself to identify specific questions for your instructors and TAs. Don't resign yourself to simply saying, "I'm totally lost." Come prepared to show your effort and thought patterns, we'll be happy to help along the way.

Always commit your work and back it up with GitHub pushes. You don't want to lose hours of your work because you didn't push it to GitHub every half hour or so.

Commit often.
